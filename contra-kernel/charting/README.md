# Notes while charting

- it is very simple to query and dump into a dataframe for post processing;
- a dataframe is 1-to-1 with a table returned from the query;
- it is simple to massage data in the dataframe and create plots.
  It can be a simple way to show what one wants to achieve,
  then one can find a optimized / efficient way of reaching the result;
- it is super simple to generate all types of charts;
- SQL query can be "shared" between different consumers;
- the streamlit final example can "tell a story" similar to JupyterNotebook
- complex to find balance between SQL query and "df massage" in post processing (in terms of performance and genericity)
